# Breast Cancer Prediction

Link to dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)-
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
